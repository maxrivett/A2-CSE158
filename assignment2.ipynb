The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009\\tAn average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.\\t\\tLightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.\\t\\tOther than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.\\t\\ther sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.\\t\\tOverall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.'},\n",

Dark chocolate, loads of anise, licorice, but very little of the latter.  Body is watery and a bit foamy, slightly tangy but without acidity.  Refreshing and dangerously easy to drink!

The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation.

The aroma is a slightly musky blend of floral, citric and lightly earthy hops over pale malt. On the light side of medium-bodied, the palate is slightly grainy with a bitter, resinous hop finish. Toasted malt with a solid hit of floral and faint citric hops, it finishes dry and bitter. This is a decent brew, but its certainly not among my favorite IPAs.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.'},\n",

Hazy light-medium amber color, full of particulates, with a very fine but lasting head. Flavor profile follows the aroma rather closely, primarily showcasing the hop presence, which makes itself known here in the form of a light acidity and increasing bitterness, alongside the juicy citrus, leafy herbal qualities and faint, grainy malt sweetness.  Semi-dry and thin on the palate with plenty of effervescence and a medium body.  Does feature a nice amount of hoppiness, but is a bit thinner and less complex than many others of this style.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '2006 bottle from MI2CA drunk on 1/11/07Cant figure out the bottling methods of these guys.  It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.  Not sure on the carbonation, I suspect its forced, but thats ok, Ill let them off the hook for that.  It comes across well enough.'},\n",

Slightly hazed orange color with a small, foamy head. Something about the hops/malt balance in this beer reminds me of an American  barleywine though, of course, at a much more moderate level. The malts are more dominant but the hops are strong and cant be ignored. Its sweet w/ melon and pine hop notes along w/ a gentle iced tea astringency. By the end of my glass I am definitely ready to say that this is not an IPA but, whatever it is, I like it just fine. Its well balanced in its own way and while its not the most vibrant thing in the world, I cant complain about anything.'},\n",

Hops add a small amount of earthy quality. Rather dry with a low fruitiness, but overall pretty nice.\\t\\t4.0 T: Taste is much like the nose. Nutty, toasty, biscuity malts, and toffee are all there again. Theres a barely detectable almost buttery flavor (though not exactly buttery) than complements the flavors well. A little sweeter than the nose suggests, but not much. Hops are mainly earthy with a touch of citrus.\\t\\t4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate spritzy carbonation. Somewhat slippery creaminess and quite smooth. \\t\\t4.5 D: Based on the scores for this, this was a wonderful surprise. Overall a very solid brown ale that I wouldnt mind drinking from time to time.

Didnt really get any flavors outside of brusque alcohol and maybe some hops.  A very different beer from Newcastle and I strongly prefer the former.  Best part of this beer is the color: its a beautiful dark red-brown.  Best paired with cold weather and limited expectations.'},\n",

The stale air continues to plague this one - is it oxidation?  Lasts through the aftertaste.  Potent initial taste, will give it that.  Some oats and acidity, and a light woody note to accompany the mild bitterness.  Medium-light body with an occasional swish of sweetish creaminess.  Touch of hop prickle in the finish.

The flavor profile is sweet mocha,  toasted grain, walnut, with a light background of acidic fruit and some mild bitterness.

Perfect weight in mouth. Bittersweet chocolate carries through. Bit of bitterness on the tounge. Mid roast. Bit thin on finish-could use a bit more there. But super solid beer here. Add this one to the rotation.'},\n",

First warm day of a Carolina spring and I want a roasty oatmeal stout? Eh, whatever. At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session. Enjoyable even so, and big ups to Josh for giving me a chance to taste this.'},\n",

The nose is very chocolaty and roasty with some light chalkiness and coffee.  The flavor is overly roasted to the point where its just too chalky and ashy with some light coffee and milk chocolate on the finish.  I dont get any oatmeal influence at all on either the flavor or body.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with a watery texture and moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  Quite a long lingering finish.  Overalll, this was just a ho-hum middle of the road Stout at best.'},\n",

Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.

Just plain bad...I wasnt the only one who thought that. I shared it with four other people and they all said the same thing. Low carbonation. Over all a drain pour.... Which kind of upsets me since Josh worked so hard to get me this beer. Maybe it was a bad growler. I will have to re-rate if I ever go visit Indiana...Thanks Josh for going beyond the call of duty to get this beer for me!'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Bottle...beautiful looking beer upon pouring, dark black with a good sized tan head.  Nose has a load of roasted malts, coffee, dark brown sugar, vanilla, oak and some toasted coconut.  The bourbon is there but it is very subtle as previously noted in other reviews.  I love the mouth feel on this, very silky, well carbonated and not overly thick/heavy.  Flavor is dark roasted coffee, some vanilla extract, woodsy and again a bit of toasted coconut.  Overall I really enjoyed this for not being over-the-top in the bourbon department, it seems as though this whole bourbon aging thing has got a bit ridiculous and this is a nice change of pace.  Subtle but very nice brew.Earlier Rating: 5/24/2007 Total Score: 3.4Bottle pours a deep mahogany/cherry wood color with a minimal tan head.  Smells of some, believe it or not, chocolate-covered strawberries, malt, and some faint bourbon.  I know, chocolate-covered strawberries you say?  Surely I most be kidding, but I do not kid.  As a disclaimer I must say this is the first bourbon barrel-aged beer that Ive had and I sure did get smacked across the face with some bourbon on the finish.  Overall, this was a decent brew, a little thin with good flavor and a nice bourbon kick.'},\n",

Random spotting marks the glass.  Aromas include burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, mocha, vanilla, and faint hints of bourbon.  It is mostly sweet smelling, with traces of earthy hops lending just a hint of bitterness.  The bourbon is very subtle, almost unnoticeable at first, eventually folding into the brew quite nicely.  Flavors follow suit, sweet cocoa and scorched caramel leading the charge, with oaky vanilla, earthy spice, and traces of sour mash bourbon to follow.  The mouthfeel is medium-full and somewhat syrupy, its substance coming mostly from the sugar profile.  Still, it never gets cloying or overly sticky.  This is not a bad brew at all.

Seriously.)\\t<font size=-4>From an old notebook (circa October 2007). I think <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/View-User-14352.htm&amp;g split this with me. If so, thanks!</font>'},\n",

The flavor found semi-sweet chocolate and toasted caramel at the core with a restrained, yet complementary barrel treatment.. sweet, roasty finish with chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.  Lighter carbonation on the palate with a dry barrel impression.. felt good, and quite satisfying on the finish.  Nice one!Earlier Rating: 8/5/2007 Total Score: 3.8Bottle thanks to Mike, I believe.  Poured a clear, deeper brown with a cool swirly dusting of deep beige head and what appeared to be legs running down the sides of the glass.  The aroma definitely focused on the barrel aspect, with sweet vanilla, bourbon, and lightly-charred oak representin... although none of these characteristics were abrasive, and the underlying stout was quite nice with medium-roasted chocolate and mild lactic notes.  The flavor had nice roasty chocolate again at the core with some sweet oats.. barrel accent was very well executed with vanilla bean and bourbon accents.. finish was somewhat long, beginning with roasted bakers chocolate and transitioning to sweet bourbon, oak char, and mild lactic sourness.  About medium-bodied on the palate with higher carbonation (a touch too high.. filling up the mouth too rapidly).  All in all a very good beer!'},\n",

The flavor is pretty thin with a mix of chalky roast, vanilla extract, and a light lactic tinge.  Very, very, light barrel influence.

A 1+ finger chocolate head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a whispy cap with thick edges. Leaves sticky thin drink lines with each sip that slowly fall back into the body. This beer looks good but menecing at the same time.\\t\\tThe aroma starts off with a solid base of malt. Coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate are both present and very enjoyable. A perfect blend of vanilla bean, some musty wood, and mild bourbon come in flashes over the malts. This is a wonderful warm smelling beer.\\t\\tThe flavor is all in the aroma. The chocolate maltiness starts things off and is quickly followed by coffee beans at mid-palate. The coffee beans follow through to the finish and are accompanied by lightly roasted grains. The vanilla and mild bourbon leave a very pleasant coating that lasts a few seconds after the swallow. Leaves a mildly bitter coffee aftertaste.\\t\\tMedium body with a nice creaminess from the barrel aging. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through at its own pace. \\t\\tThis is definately a highly drinkable beer. Very enjoyable and not heavy like most of the barrel aged stouts you run into. Lower abv lets you enjoy a few glasses without being too much.\\t\\tThis beer is a huge surprise. I saw the average score before I reviewed and after sampling this bottle I really cant understand why its so low. This is a wonderful beer. If its retired I hope they plan to bring it back at some point. Really well made beer.\\t\\tNotes: I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong.

The aroma is coffee, raisins, whisky, and hints of alcohol, caramel, and toffee. The flavor is dominated by interesting coffee notes, with some distant bitter chocolate. Some smoky bourbon notes come out once in a while, but not too often (as seems to frequently be the case with barrel aged stuff). The aftertaste is quite warm. Grainy oat flavor is apparent at times, too, though not as smoothly as other oatmeal stouts. Pretty good in all.'},\n",

The aroma obviously has bourbon and a chocolate nut bar. The oats are very much noticed. In the mouth bourbon is easily noticed, but it doesnt overwhelm or interrupt the other flavors of the stout. Rather, it melds well with the chocolate/coffee flavors not to mention the dense toasted oats. The finish reminds me of a Girl Scout Samoa cookie, just imagine it not being sweet.

The aroma is pretty nice, with HUGE bourbon, backed up by ashy roast and coffee.  The flavor is all right, but WAY too big on bourbon.  That dominates the flavor, and a dry and ashy espressoish stout hides behind it.  Medium-bodied with a rather dry mouthfeel, and a bit boozy for 6%, from all the bourbon I guess.  Overall, a bit unbalanced.  If they were able to fine-tune the -bal aging though, I could see this being pretty good.'},\n",

It took 4 series of pouring and waiting for the head to subside to get 3/4s of a glass.  The flavor is kind of odd.  Some swallows the bourbon is up front and others it is in the finish.  I dont know that Ive experienced that before.  There is some chocolate in there, as well.  Fairly thin for the style and lacking the creaminess that is typical for an Oatmeal Stout.  Interesting as most bourbon-aged beers are.  Another rater said that it is too small for the bourbon and that may be true.  Hopefully theyll stick with it and tweak it.  Shows promise.'},\n",

If this isnt forced carbonation, than its the strangest natural carbonation Ive ever experienced.  Deep cola brown, somewhat dull, not much in the auburn-red tinged department, as some deeper colored stouts have.  Tan-beige head is mountainous and very very slow to recede.  Lacing present.  Aroma of straight bourbon, dry and lightly alcoholic, with light vanilla and very dry wood.  Hints of bakers chocolate, some light yeast and very little else.  No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic.'},\n",

The barrel aging is upfront and the feel is weak. With some tweeking, this beer could rock. I have only the one bottle but would pick up another or two for a rerate and trade if I can find it.'},\n",

First whiff is watered down whiskey/bourbon.  Beyond that its chocolate, light roasty malt with a very, very subdued raisiny dark fruit character.  Toasted oatmeal when it warms along with oak woody notes and hints of vanilla.  Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.  A little thin in the mouth, but overall I think a very fine beer!  Great nose, above average palate, but the body killed the overall experience for me.'},\n",

This beer pours black in color with a slightly creamy orange head which lasted nicely. The aroma is vanilla, oak, cocoa, coffee, tree twigs, and heavy black currants. Complex and sweet aroma...very nice. The taste is very oaty, bready and earthy, with chocolate, vanilla, milkiness, heavy bourbon, wood, tree twigs, and cotton candy. Once again, an incredibly complex taste for such an unheard of beer. Dry roasty finish, some sweet vanilla and brown sugar...great mouhtfeel. Very nice BA Oatmeal Stout.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Deep ebony with a maple border. Fizzling foam subsides to a dark tan  edge. Mellow aroma of vanilla, tar, cola, back licorice, and sharp bourbon. Moderate roastiness and moist soil notes. Fuzzy carbonation. Tannins add some firmness to the slick body. Soft cottony roastiness embraces the  delicate bourbon flavors. Brief earthy hop appearance at the heart of the brew. Rich toasted wood undertones couple with charred malts, adding even more firmness to the flavor. Bourbon is remarkably clean and perfumey, yet sweet enough to withstand the harsh malts and brighten the aforementioned subtleties of the whiskey. Gentle notes of vanilla and caramel cushion the vague acidity. Toasted wood and chalky black malts deepen the bourbon flavors in the finish with their resilient dryness. Delicate remnants of vanilla and black malt hulls on the tongue. This could benefit from a heartier aroma and more body/creamier carbonation. Otherwise, this is very well balanced and packs a delicious bourbon flavor.'},\n",

Thick, rich, and creamy bourbon and chocolate. A light burnt coffee, vanilla-oak, and some molasses. Mainly malty with lots of chocolate and the sweet bourbon isnt overly oaky and not boozey at all. Flavor is thinner than I anticipated, but thats only because the aroma smelled so thick. Lots of wood, chocolate, and vanilla up front with some sweet bourbon. The bourbon blends nicely with the rest of the flavors and doesnt stand out as much as the aroma. Some charred coffee grows slightly into the finish along with more bourbon and sweet malts. Finishes with a dry, woody, coffee, malty, bourbon sweetness and a hint of acidity. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and moderate, fizzy carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice barrel-aged stout. Fairly sweet with a nice charred flavor. Enjoyable.'},\n",

Lightish-bodied, if that can be believed! Relatively thin mouthful with a lot of oak and bourbon at first with some mild malt, bitter nuts and a twang of vanilla at the end. Aftertaste is mild, some alcohol is noticeable, but mainly a light finish of bourbon and roasted malt - nice, since its not so strong! Overall, a very well done beer that showcases the flavours and doesnt get drowned out by the alcohol! The smaller sized bottle is another plus - perfect for the style, and this isnt even strong, so thats perfect. Id recommend this to others and will pick up the Porter the next time Im in Chicago.

Noticeable, but not dominating vanilla, ala bourbon.  Chocolate and roast backfill.  Fruity acidity in the finish.  Long lingering charcoal roast.  Perhaps the slightest hint of bourobn after the aftertaste.  Not bad.Earlier Rating: 4/17/2007 Total Score: 3.2Pours a dark dark brown with a thin tan head, thinning to nothing but a glass hugging  brown foam.  The nose is very boozy.  I know its just the barrel, but the nose makes me think alcohol.  Whiskey, a little wood, a little chocolate malt, floral hops, something green seems a bit off.  The mouthfeel is about average for the style, low carbonation and a hint of thickness, but not too chewy, not too fizzy.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, but the alcohol seems to come out a bit more.  I have a hard time believing the ABV is < 5.  Chocolate malt character over the whiskey slightly woody flavor.  The alcohol whiskey element is so sweet, a little hoppy, not much roast, but a little acidic.  Boozy finish, whiskey aftertaste.  The whiskey flavors balance the sweetness, but I find this to be a bit much.'},\n",

I just figured out why barrel is in the name. Finishes smooth and somewhat astringent - or maybe thats my mouth trying to suck up the last flavor bits from my gums. Seriously, it is very good.

But I did want to try this at GABF, but never got around to it with all the other good beers around.  Then a shining opportunity came when Schroppfy rated this and well he had a bottle for me to rate, score!  Well, this pours completely black and very thick.  The visible thickness of the beer is a welcomed surprise. The head is small but strong with a sticky thick lacing.  The head itself is a nice brown color.  The aroma has a lot of chocolate and strong wood alcohol essence but the alcohol is not too strong for the thick, lightly roasted stout-y aspects.  Also there is a thick cereal sweetness.  In the taste that wood alcohol essence grows, so it interferes with the other chocolate flavors.  However, the my favorite part is the mouthfeel on this brew. Its just so thick and lusciously velvety.  There is a reduced carbonation and it is tongue coating.  I feel like the Venoms alien symbiote is taking over my tongue.  This is probably the best BA low alcohol beer I have ever had, not much competition there though. Hmmm... now I need the Beastie Barrel Porter, damn my vanity. 12oz bottle into a Chimay miniature goblet.'},\n",

Aroma of stale coffee (spent espresso grounds) some oak, and a bit of molasses. Very dry. At first, you think the stale coffee is going to steal the show, but after a second, you start to detect some sweeter undertones - the malts begin to show through the bitter front end. Its still very dry - some smokey meats coming through as well - but is far more pleasant than it first lets on. This would be fantastic with a good protein-laden dinner - Im thinking ribs with a good bbq sauce. Very decent overall.'},\n",

This one has a big roasty nose, rich toasted malts with a strong barrel presence to it as well. The pour is moderate, with a decent tan head and prickly carbonation. The bourbon tends to dominate a bit too much in the taste, overwhelming some of whats there in the solid base beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thin too. But its a decent brew that Im glad to have tried.'},\n",

More vanilla sweetness is prevelant than a dense caramel which may be commonly found in this style. There are oak, cola,  and sarsaparilla flavors here as well. No hop character to speak of.

       "  'review/text': 'Bottle (341ml).  Shared with blankboy, his bottle.  Opaque, thick near-black with a small creamy/frothy brown head (4+).  Very bitter dark roast - coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a hint of soy, also green hops and molasses ... and I detected a slightly off note, vaguely like plastic.  Excellent roast flavour, very bitter roast coffee beans, smooth and balanced, a hint of sour cherry tartness in the finish.  Silky, fairly thick mouthfeel, lightly astringent, moderately acidic, with a fairly quick finish.  Seemed more like an excellent coffee porter than a stout, but I quibbling - apart from that odd plastic note, this was really good.'},\n",

The aroma is full of dark roasted coffee, black patent malt, and roast.  The flavor is a little too heavy on the burnt malt, lending an ashy chalkiness that overpowers the coffee and roast notes.  The coffee does come out nicely on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, watery in texture, but not thin, with moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  This was OK, but not up there with my favorite coffee beers.  A far cry from Bells Java.'},\n",

Aroma heightens the anticipation, emitting black fudge brownies, unrefined mocha beans covered in dark chocolate, hints of Madagascar vanilla bean and baked mocha torte sauce. Flavor onsets with too much frits and feverishly dissipates across the palate. Astringent edges curtail around the outer realm while a charred, French roast coffee flavor gets hard pressed to the top of burnt brownies. Hallow in all areas, and at its best in the sweetened vanilla mocha finish. Stretched too far to make an impact. Thanks for bringing it, MrFacto!'},\n",

Although totally one dimensional, the coffee that dominates the aroma is really pleasant and smells quite fresh. Also noted are sweet and black malts, oats, a sugary component that just feels like sugar added to coffee. This nose is very pleasant, bold too, just so lopsided. Quite tasty. Roasty coffee pervades, followed by well balanced roasted grains in good quantity, mild chocolate and milder still vanilla to round things out. Finishes off dry and mildly roasty. The bitterness that lingers throughout keeps this beer balanced and makes it incredibly quaffable. Nicely surprising, a well done coffee beer.'},\n",

Its super concentrated...one of the most powerfully coffee smelling beers youll sniff. One dimendsional? You bet, but it smells good. The body is basically black with a few hints at a ruddy dark brown. The head is dimishing, mocha colored and starts about a thumb thick. Bitter/acidic coffee fore. Very dark coffee/dark chocolate in the fore. It then gets sweet with cream, milk chocolate and sweet malt through the middle. There are also bitter roast malt and coffee accents on into the finish and what may be a pretty healthy dose of hops or just the bitterness from the coffee. You like coffee? Then you cant dislike this. Again....fairly one dimensional, but fun to drink.'},\n",

Not bad.<font size=-4>From the cellar of <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=1 size=-1>'},\n",

The nose detects a lot of espresso, roasted and burnt malt, oat, chocolate, plum, a hint of pepper, and grassy hops. The taste profile is one that starts coffee-ish and mostly stays that way throughout the tasting. What helps is an addition of fruity rind acidity and some hop character along with a dash of ashy yeast character. The finish is quite bitter and dry. The mouth feel is thinner than that of the regular Oatmeal stout for some reason, maybe the coffee bitterness gives a sense of thinness. It is very oily however. A good brew and I like it because I like coffee stouts but the average person may not care for a much, not subdued for sure.'},\n",

Anyways, I dug the hell out of this rich and sessionable beer. Big nose is just what I want, roasted coffee out the wazoo. Thick and black, with a big-ass foamy head. The body is moderate, perhaps even slightly too thin. The mouthfeel is chalky in a way I think is appropriate to style. Deep coffee flavors with dry dark chocolate too. Is it perhaps one-dimensional? Sure, but I actually want precisely this from a coffee stout in this style. Its not gonna replace Breakfast Stout but its damn fine. Thanks, bro!!!'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'In short: A highly roasted stout (and I mean HIGHLY roasted) balanced by fresh green hops.  Very good.\\tHow: Bottle 12oz, from kmweaver.  Thanks a lot Ken!\\tThe look: Black body topped by a long-lasting small tan head.\\tIn long: Nose is roasted, more roasted, even more roasted.  I could smell the roastiness from 2 feet away and to a lower extent the aroma had some roasted coffee beans.  Taste is more of the same, roasted malts, hightly roasted malts and very highly roasted malts.  All that roastiness would only be ok but where it gets interesting is in the balance part of the beer.  A whole lots of fresh green hops in there was somewhat reminiscent of chewing on hops cone.  Good session beer that has even more burnt flavour than my girlfriends cooking.'},\n",

While it carried with it a really inticing aroma of chocolate covered espresso beans,  treacle, and toffee, the flavor really was a let down.  It had a nice coffee/dark chocolate beginning and then, bam...nothing.  It just dropped off the palate in an instant and what was left reminded me of drinking a seltzer water.  A nice black hue, medium bodied with a one-finger thick tan head.  I think if the beer had more depth of flavor, it would score much higher with me.  Decent beer, but could have been much, much better.'},\n",

Beer has a nice mouthfeel with some good stout tones, but finish tastes like the old coffee grounds that you throw away once you are done brewing coffee.  Just too bitter and strong old coffee flavor.  Even so it is pretty decent.'},\n",

The oatmeal not only adds body to this stout but adds a nice smoothness.  The buttery flavor comes out especially well in the finish.  With the medium-to-low alcohol this beer sports you could tag this as a great session beer.  If I were to suggest any improvement it would be to add a touch more oatmeal to balance out the hop & java bean bitterness.

       "  'review/text': '3-5 month old bottle from Shigadeyo, drunk on 11/2/07Black body, with a medium-high clarity and a large, light-tan head showing moderate retention and light lacing.Typical coffee stout aroma, and fortunately, its very aromatic.  Vanilla, fresh beans, dry chocolate notes and tastefully light amounts of caramel collect at the edge of the nose.  Light hop bitterness invigorates the senses and pushes the coffee and malt flavors through to the finish.  Some crispy popcorn-like notes nearly remind of diacetyl, but I dont think there is any here.  Quite dry and with that papery, beany note that is inevitable in coffee stouts.  Hop resins persist on the end, but the smooth choco-vanilla malts do not peter out.  No alcohol noted, medium-high to high strength of aroma.Very soft, but high levels of carbonation lend a creamy-fluffy feel to the body, as light chocolate fudge braces the palate for a big dose of roasty coffee and strong vanilla flavors.  It slowly dries the palate, with help from hop bitterness and slightly astringent black malts.  Caramel sweetness perks up as it warms and breathes, and light looseness in the body is exposed as well.  No alcohol noted and quite drinkable.  Perhaps a little less caramel sweetness and more interplay between vinousness and coffee would help.  I dont see the need for this much pine and citrus bitterness either.'},\n",

Sweet and bitter orange peels abate the nose, along with cloves, banana, orange zest, lemon seeds and buttery vanilla.  Sugary refreshment hits the tongue and reveals a touch of fusel burn and a hopped up anthem.  Effervescence meets husks and coriander thats been dashed far too liberally.  Orangey stream teams with green buds and dry bitterness.  Medium-bodied with curtailing pils malt and a lemon juice flavor shine on grapefruit rind shavings.  Harsh bitterness is never dormant, and quite dominant especially in the end, meeting up with bitter orange peel for the last goodbye.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '12oz. bottle.  Malty, toasty, floral aroma, lightly sweet, citric and leafy with notes of pine, grapefruit, dusty, faintly doughy yeast and touches of light caramel.  Hazy light-medium amber color, unfiltered and conditioned, and yielding a fairly slight, thin head.  Flavors include a blend of citrus fruitiness, gentle sweetness, lightly toasty malts and a wash of faint bitterness and acidity throughout.  Rather thin, finely effervescent mouthfeel, body is light-medium.  Early on, the malt seems to make its presence felt quite a bit more, but as the finish fades away, the hop character is what lingers.  A serviceable enough Pale.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) Another massively overcarbonated bottle of beer that despite the careful pour has yielded more head than actual beer.  Also, the nose is fairly soapy, which often seems to go hand-in-hand with the massive carbonation.  Anyway, after several minutes, the foamy, light-tan has died down to only a quarter-inch, so I can finally proceed.  Well, the flavor is also moderately soapy, but its mild enough that I can overlook it and focus on the other flavors.  Mildly sweet, fruity, and lightly malty initially, the finish shows some mild but balancing bitterness, as well as a light smokiness.  It tastes okay, I guess, certainly nothing special, but of course, that soapiness cant be ignored either.  Unfortunately, I cant smell much beyond the soapiness, maybe some sweet fruitiness and some floral hops.  Body is about medium, and despite the huge head, carbonation on the palate isnt expansive at all.  Dark amber in color and fairly cloudy with some small, dark specks settling to the bottom of the glass.  The head never fades below a thin but complete layer, and there is a significant amount of foam left on the glass.  Not a great introduction to this brewery, but Im hopeful some of the others will be better.'},\n",
